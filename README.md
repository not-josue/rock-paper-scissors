# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Solution to the [Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Rock, Paper, Scissors JavaScript [Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors). This one differs as it doesn't use `prompt()`, and doesn't continuously play 5 rounds before deciding a winner.

Instead a user clicks a `button` to play a round, then clicks a `button` to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The result is displayed on the page, and the score is updated.
